# Malicious-App-for-Android-

In this report, we have shown how we can hack an android mobile device using MSF
venom and the Metasploit framework. We will use MSF venom for generating the
payload, save it as an .apk file and set up a listener to the Metasploit framework. Once
the user/victim downloads and install the malicious .apk, an attacker can easily get back
the session on Metasploit. To accomplish this, an attacker needs to do some social
engineering to install the .apk on the victimâ€™s mobile device.
