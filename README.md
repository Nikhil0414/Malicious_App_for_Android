# Malicious-App-for-Android-

In this report, we have shown how we can hack an android mobile device using MSF
venom and the Metasploit framework. We will use MSF venom for generating the
payload, save it as an .apk file and set up a listener to the Metasploit framework. Once
the user/victim downloads and install the malicious .apk, an attacker can easily get back
the session on Metasploit. To accomplish this, an attacker needs to do some social
engineering to install the .apk on the victimâ€™s mobile device.

The payload successfully penetrated the Android device using Kali Linux and penetration testing tools(Metasploit).
Successful creation and deployment of virus for android injected with payload in the form of an android app. With the help of our malicious .apk file (virus app for android) named Notes(apk).
